This tool updates your Go import lines, adding missing ones and
removing unreferenced ones.

     $ go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports

     Note the new location. This project has moved to the official
     go.tools repo. Pull requests here will no longer be accepted.
     Please use the Go process: http://golang.org/doc/contribute.html

It acts the same as gofmt (same flags, etc) but in addition to code
formatting, also fixes imports.

See usage and editor integration notes, now moved elsewhere:

   http://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports

Happy hacking!
