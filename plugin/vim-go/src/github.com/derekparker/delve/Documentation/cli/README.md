Aliases: disass

## down
Move the current frame down.

  down [<m>]
  down [<m>] <command>

Move the current frame down by <m>. The second form runs the command on the given frame.


## exit
Exit the debugger.

Aliases: quit q

## frame
Set the current frame, or execute command on a different frame.

  frame <m>
  frame <m> <command>

The first form sets frame used by subsequent commands such as "print" or "set".
The second form runs the command on the given frame.


## funcs

## goroutines
List program goroutines.

	goroutines [-u (default: user location)|-r (runtime location)|-g (go statement location)]

Print out info for every goroutine. The flag controls what information is shown along with each goroutine:

## sources
Print list of source files.

	sources [<regex>]
