gogetdoc
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zmb3/gogetdoc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zmb3/gogetdoc)

Retrieve documentation for items in Go source code.

Go has a variety of tools that make it easy to lookup documentation.
There's the `godoc` HTTP server, the `go doc` command line tool, and https://godoc.org.

These tools are great, but in many cases one may find it valuable to lookup
documentation right from their editor.  The problem with all of these tools
is that they are all meant to be used by a person who knows what they are
looking for.  This makes editor integration difficult, as there isn't an easy way
to say "get me the documentation for this item here."

The `gogetdoc` tool aims to make it easier for editors to provide access to
Go documentation.  Simply give it a filename and offset within the file and
it will figure out what you're referring to and find the documentation
for it.

## Usage

Simply specify a filename and _byte_ offset with the `pos` flag:

```
$ gogetdoc -pos "$(go env GOROOT)/src/fmt/format.go:#2351"
import "unicode/utf8"

func RuneCountInString(s string) (n int)

RuneCountInString is like RuneCount but its input is a string.

```

The `-json` flag can be used to enable the extended JSON output.
In this mode, a JSON object will be written to stdout instead of the raw doc.

    {
      "name": "RuneCountInString",
      "import": "unicode/utf8",
      "pkg": "utf8",
      "decl": "func RuneCountInString(s string) (n int)",
      "doc": "RuneCountInString is like RuneCount but its input is a string.\n",
      "pos": "/usr/local/Cellar/go/1.9/libexec/src/unicode/utf8/utf8.go:412:6"
    }

### Unsaved files

`gogetdoc` supports the same archive format as `guru` (formerly `oracle`).
Editors can supply `gogetdoc` with the contents of unsaved buffers by
using the `-modified` flag and writing an archive to stdin.  
Files in the archive will be preferred over those on disk.

Each archive entry consists of:
 - the file name, followed by a newline
 - the (decimal) file size, followed by a newline
 - the contents of the file
