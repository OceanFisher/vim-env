INTRODUCTION                                    *command-t-intro*

The Command-T plug-in provides an extremely fast, intuitive mechanism for
opening files and buffers with a minimal number of keystrokes. It's named
"Command-T" because it is inspired by the "Go to File" window bound to
Command-T in TextMate.

Files are selected by typing characters that appear in their paths, and are
ordered by an algorithm which knows that characters that appear in certain
locations (for example, immediately after a path separator) should be given
more weight.

To search efficiently, especially in large projects, you should adopt a
"path-centric" rather than a "filename-centric" mentality. That is you should
think more about where the desired file is found rather than what it is
called. This means narrowing your search down by including some characters
from the upper path components rather than just entering characters from the
filename itself.


REQUIREMENTS                                    *command-t-requirements*

The plug-in requires Vim compiled with Ruby support, a compatible Ruby
installation at the operating system level, and a C compiler to build
the Ruby extension.


1. Vim compiled with Ruby support ~

You can check for Ruby support by launching Vim with the --version switch:

  vim --version

If "+ruby" appears in the version information then your version of Vim has
Ruby support.

Another way to check is to simply try using the :ruby command from within Vim
itself:

  :ruby 1

If your Vim lacks support you'll see an error message like this:

  E319: Sorry, the command is not available in this version

The version of Vim distributed with OS X may not include Ruby support (for
example, Snow Leopard, which was the current version of OS X when Command-T
was first released, did not support Ruby in the system Vim, but the current
version of OS X at the time of writing, Mavericks, does). All recent versions
of MacVim come with Ruby support; it is available from:

  http://macvim-dev.github.io/macvim/

For Windows users, the Vim 7.2 executable available from www.vim.org does
include Ruby support, and is recommended over version 7.3 (which links against
Ruby 1.9, but apparently has some bugs that need to be resolved).


2. Ruby ~

In addition to having Ruby support in Vim, your system itself must have a
compatible Ruby install. "Compatible" means the same version as Vim itself
links against. If you use a different version then Command-T is unlikely
to work (see |command-t-trouble-shooting| below).

On OS X Snow Leopard, Lion and Mountain Lion, the system comes with Ruby 1.8.7
and all recent versions of MacVim (the 7.2 snapshots and 7.3) are linked
against it.

On OS X Mavericks, the default system Ruby is 2.0, but MacVim continues to
link against 1.8.7, as does the Apple-provided Vim. Ruby 1.8.7 is present on
the system at:

  /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/bin/ruby

On OS X Yosemite, the default system Ruby is 2.0, and the Vim that comes with
the system links against it.

On Linux and similar platforms, the linked version of Ruby will depend on
your distribution. You can usually find this out by examining the
compilation and linking flags displayed by the |:version| command in Vim, and
by looking at the output of:

  :ruby puts "#{RUBY_VERSION}-p#{RUBY_PATCHLEVEL}"

Or, for very old versions of Ruby which don't define `RUBY_PATCHLEVEL`:

  :ruby puts RUBY_VERSION

Some Linux distributions package Ruby development tools separately from Ruby
itself; if you're using such a system you may need to install the "ruby-dev",
"ruby-devel" or similar package using your system's package manager in order
to build Command-T.

A suitable Ruby environment for Windows can be installed using the Ruby
1.8.7-p299 RubyInstaller available at:

  http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/archives

If using RubyInstaller be sure to download the installer executable, not the
7-zip archive. When installing mark the checkbox "Add Ruby executables to your
PATH" so that Vim can find them.


3. C compiler ~

Part of Command-T is implemented in C as a Ruby extension for speed, allowing
it to work responsively even on directory hierarchies containing enormous
numbers of files. As such, a C compiler is required in order to build the
extension and complete the installation.

On OS X, this can be obtained by installing the Xcode Tools from the App
Store.

On Windows, the RubyInstaller Development Kit can be used to conveniently
install the necessary tool chain:

  http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/archives

At the time of writing, the appropriate development kit for use with Ruby
1.8.7 is DevKit-3.4.5r3-20091110.

To use the Development Kit extract the archive contents to your C:\Ruby
folder.


INSTALLATION                                    *command-t-installation*

You install Command-T by obtaining the source files and building the C
extension.

The recommended way to get the source is by using a plug-in management system.
There are several such systems available, and my preferred one is Pathogen
(https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) due to its simplicity and robustness.

Other plug-in managers include:

- Vundle: https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim (see |command-t-vundle|)
- NeoBundle: https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim (see
  |command-t-neobundle|)
- VAM: https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager (see |command-t-vam|)
- vim-plug: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug (see |command-t-vim-plug|)

The following sections outline how to use each of these managers to download
Command-T, and finally |command-t-compile| describes how to compile it.

                                                         *command-t-pathogen*
Obtaining the source using Pathogen ~

Pathogen is a plugin that allows you to maintain plugin installations in
separate, isolated subdirectories under the "bundle" directory in your
|'runtimepath'|. The following examples assume that you already have
Pathogen installed and configured, and that you are installing into
`~/.vim/bundle`.

If you manage your entire `~/.vim` folder using Git then you can add the
Command-T repository as a submodule:

  cd ~/.vim
  git submodule add https://github.com/wincent/command-t.git bundle/command-t
  git submodule init

Or if you just wish to do a simple clone instead of using submodules:

  cd ~/.vim
  git clone https://github.com/wincent/command-t.git bundle/command-t

Once you have a local copy of the repository you can update it at any time
with:

  cd ~/.vim/bundle/command-t
  git pull

Or you can switch to a specific release with:

  cd ~/.vim/bundle/command-t
  git checkout 1.10

To generate the help tags under Pathogen it is necessary to do so explicitly
from inside Vim:

  :call pathogen#helptags()

For more information about Pathogen, see:

  https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen

                                                           *command-t-vundle*
Obtaining the source using Vundle ~

Anywhere between the calls to `vundle#begin` and `vundle#end` in your
|.vimrc|, add a `Plugin` directive telling Vundle of your desire to use
Command-T:

  call vundle#begin()
  Plugin 'wincent/command-t'
  call vundle#end()

To actually install the plug-in run `:PluginInstall` from inside Vim. After
this, you can proceed to compile Command-T (see |command-t-compile|).

For more information about Vundle, see:

  https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim

                                                        *command-t-neobundle*
Obtaining the source using NeoBundle ~

Anywhere between the calls to `neobundle#begin` and `neobundle#end` in your
|.vimrc|, add a `NeoBundle` directive telling NeoBundle of your desire to use
Command-T:

  call neobundle#begin(expand('~/.vim/bundle/'))
  NeoBundle 'wincent/command-t'
  call neobundle#end()

To actually install the plug-in run `:NeoBundleInstall` from inside Vim. After
this, you can proceed to compile Command-T (see |command-t-compile|) manually,
or if you wish to have NeoBundle attempt to do so automatically, you can use a
configuration like this:

  call neobundle#begin(expand('~/.vim/bundle/'))
  NeoBundle 'wincent/command-t', {
    \   'build_commands': ['make', 'ruby'],
    \   'build': {
    \      'unix': 'cd ruby/command-t/ext/command-t && { make clean; ruby extconf.rb && make }'
    \   }
    \ }
  call neobundle#end()

For more information about NeoBundle, see:

  https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim

                                                              *command-t-vam*
Obtaining the source using VAM ~

After the call to `vam#ActivateAddons` in your |.vimrc|, add Command-T to
the `VAMActivate` call:

  call vam#ActivateAddons([])
  VAMActivate github:wincent/command-t

After VAM has downloaded Command-T, you can proceed to compile it (see
|command-t-compile|).

For more information about VAM, see:

  https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager

                                                           *command-t-vim-plug*
Obtaining the source using vim-plug ~

Anywhere between the calls to `plug#begin` and `plug#end` in your
|.vimrc|, add a `Plug` directive telling vim-plug of your desire to use
Command-T:

  call plug#begin()
  Plug 'wincent/command-t'
  call plug#end()

To actually install the plug-in run `:PlugInstall` from inside Vim. After
this, you can proceed to compile Command-T (see |command-t-compile|) manually,
or if you wish to have vim-plug attempt to do so automatically, you can use a
configuration like this:

  call plug#begin()
  Plug 'wincent/command-t', {
    \   'do': 'cd ruby/command-t/ext/command-t && ruby extconf.rb && make'
    \ }
  call plug#end()

For more information about vim-plug, see:

  https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

                                                         *command-t-compile*
Compiling Command-T ~

The C extension must be built, which can be done from the shell. If you use a
typical Pathogen, Vundle or NeoBundle set-up then the files were installed inside
`~/.vim/bundle/command-t`. A typical VAM installation path might be
`~/.vim/vim-addons/command-t`, and vim-plug would be
`~/.vim/plugged/Command-T/`.

Wherever the Command-T files were installed, you can build the extension by
changing to the `ruby/command-t/ext/command-t` subdirectory and running a
couple of commands as follows:

  cd ~/.vim/bundle/command-t/ruby/command-t/ext/command-t
  ruby extconf.rb
  make

Note: If you are an RVM or rbenv user, you must build CommandT using the same
version of Ruby that Vim itself is linked against. You can find out the
version that Vim is linked against by issuing following command inside Vim:

  :ruby puts "#{RUBY_VERSION}-p#{RUBY_PATCHLEVEL}"

Or, for very old versions of Ruby which don't define `RUBY_PATCHLEVEL`:

  :ruby puts RUBY_VERSION

You can either set your version of Ruby to the output of the above command and
then build Command-T, or re-build Vim with a version of Ruby you prefer.

To set the version of Ruby, issue one of the following commands before
the `make` command:

  rvm use VERSION # where "VERSION" is the Ruby version Vim is linked against
  rbenv local VERSION

If you decide to re-build Vim, for OS X, you can simply use Homebrew to
uninstall and re-install Vim with following commands:

  brew uninstall vim
  brew install vim

For more information about Homebrew, see:

  http://brew.sh

Note: If you are on OS X Mavericks and compiling against MacVim, the default
system Ruby is 2.0 but MacVim still links against the older 1.8.7 Ruby that is
also bundled with the system; in this case the build command becomes:

  cd ~/.vim/bundle/command-t/ruby/command-t/ext/command-t
  /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/bin/ruby extconf.rb
  make

Note: Make sure you compile targeting the same architecture Vim was built for.
For instance, MacVim binaries are built for i386, but sometimes GCC compiles
for x86_64. First you have to check the platform Vim was built for:

  vim --version
  ...
  Compilation: gcc ... -arch i386 ...
  ...

and make sure you use the correct ARCHFLAGS during compilation:

  export ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386"
  make

Note: If you are on Fedora 17+, you can install Command-T from the system
repository with:

  su -c 'yum install vim-command-t'

                                                       *command-t-appstream*
AppStream Metadata ~

When preparing a Command-T package for distribution on Linux using Gnome
Software or another AppStream compatible application, there is a metafile in
appstream directory.

You can find more about AppStream specification at:

  http://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/


TROUBLE-SHOOTING                                *command-t-trouble-shooting*

Most installation problems are caused by a mismatch between the version of
Ruby on the host operating system, and the version of Ruby that Vim itself
linked against at compile time. For example, if one is 32-bit and the other is
64-bit, or one is from the Ruby 1.9 series and the other is from the 1.8
series, then the plug-in is not likely to work.

On OS X, Apple tends to change the version of Ruby that comes with the system
with each major release. See |command-t-requirements| above for details about
specific versions. If you wish to use custom builds of Ruby or of MacVim then
you will have to take extra care to ensure that the exact same Ruby
environment is in effect when building Ruby, Vim and the Command-T extension.

For Windows, the following combination is known to work:

  - Vim 7.2 from http://www.vim.org/download.php:
      ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/pc/gvim72.exe
  - Ruby 1.8.7-p299 from http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/archives:
      http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/71492/rubyinstaller-1.8.7-p299.exe
  - DevKit 3.4.5r3-20091110 from http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/archives:
      http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/66888/devkit-3.4.5r3-20091110.7z

If a problem occurs the first thing you should do is inspect the output of:

  ruby extconf.rb
  make

During the installation, and:

  vim --version

And compare the compilation and linker flags that were passed to the
extension and to Vim itself when they were built. If the Ruby-related
flags or architecture flags are different then it is likely that something
has changed in your Ruby environment and the extension may not work until
you eliminate the discrepancy.

From inside Vim, you can confirm the version of Ruby that it is using by
issuing this command:

  :ruby puts "#{RUBY_VERSION}-p#{RUBY_PATCHLEVEL}"

Or, for very old versions of Ruby which don't define `RUBY_PATCHLEVEL`:

  :ruby puts RUBY_VERSION

Additionally, beware that if you change your installation method for Command-T
(for example, switching from one plugin manager to another) you should verify
that you remove all of the files installed by the previous installation
method; if you fail to do this, Vim may end up executing the old code,
invalidating all your attempts to get Vim and Command-T using the same version
of Ruby.

Finally, if you end up changing Ruby versions or upgrading other parts of the
system (the operating system itself, or Vim, for example), you may need to
issue an additional "make clean" before re-building Command-T; this ensures
that potentially incompatible build products are disposed of and re-created
during the build:

  make clean
  ruby extconf.rb
  make


USAGE                                           *command-t-usage*

Bring up the Command-T file window by typing:

  <Leader>t

This mapping is set up automatically for you, provided you do not already have
a mapping for <Leader>t or |:CommandT|. You can also bring up the file window
by issuing the command:

  :CommandT

A prompt will appear at the bottom of the screen along with a file window
showing all of the files in the current project (the project directory is
determined according to the value of the |g:CommandTTraverseSCM| setting,
which defaults to the SCM root of the current file).

You can pass in an optional path argument to |:CommandT| (relative to the
current working directory (|:pwd|) or absolute):

  :CommandT ../path/to/other/files

Type letters in the prompt to narrow down the selection, showing only the
files whose paths contain those letters in the specified order. Letters do not
need to appear consecutively in a path in order for it to be classified as a
match.

Once the desired file has been selected it can be opened by pressing <CR>.
(By default files are opened in the current window, but there are other
mappings that you can use to open in a vertical or horizontal split, or in
a new tab.) Note that if you have |'nohidden'| set and there are unsaved
changes in the current window when you press <CR> then opening in the current
window would fail; in this case Command-T will open the file in a new split.

The following mappings are active when the prompt has focus:

    <BS>        delete the character to the left of the cursor
    <Del>       delete the character at the cursor
    <Left>      move the cursor one character to the left
    <C-h>       move the cursor one character to the left
    <Right>     move the cursor one character to the right
    <C-l>       move the cursor one character to the right
    <C-a>       move the cursor to the start (left)
    <C-e>       move the cursor to the end (right)
    <C-u>       clear the contents of the prompt
    <Tab>       change focus to the file listing

The following mappings are active when the file listing has focus:

    <Tab>       change focus to the prompt

The following mappings are active when either the prompt or the file listing
has focus:

    <CR>        open the selected file
    <C-CR>      open the selected file in a new split window
    <C-s>       open the selected file in a new split window
    <C-v>       open the selected file in a new vertical split window
    <C-t>       open the selected file in a new tab
    <C-d>       delete the selected buffer
    <C-j>       select next file in the file listing
    <C-n>       select next file in the file listing
    <Down>      select next file in the file listing
    <C-k>       select previous file in the file listing
    <C-p>       select previous file in the file listing
    <Up>        select previous file in the file listing
    <C-f>       flush the cache (see |:CommandTFlush| for details)
    <C-q>       place the current matches in the quickfix window
    <C-c>       cancel (dismisses file listing)

The following is also available on terminals which support it:

    <Esc>       cancel (dismisses file listing)

Note that the default mappings can be overriden by setting options in your
|.vimrc| file (see the OPTIONS section for a full list of available options).

In addition, when the file listing has focus, typing a character will cause
the selection to jump to the first path which begins with that character.
Typing multiple characters consecutively can be used to distinguish between
paths which begin with the same prefix.


COMMANDS                                        *command-t-commands*

                                                *:CommandT*
|:CommandT|         Brings up the Command-T file window, starting in the current
                  working directory as returned by the|:pwd|
                  command.

                                                 *:CommandTBuffer*
|:CommandTBuffer|   Brings up the Command-T buffer window.
                  This works exactly like the standard file window,
                  except that the selection is limited to files that
                  you already have open in buffers.

                                                *:CommandTCommand*
|:CommandTCommand|  Brings up the Command-T command window. This works
                  exactly like the standard file window, except that it shows
                  the available commands to run.

                                                 *:CommandTHelp*
|:CommandTHelp|     Brings up the Command-T help search window. This works
                  exactly like the standard file window, except that it shows
                  help topics found in any documentation under Vim's
                  |'runtimepath'|.

                                                *:CommandTHistory*
|:CommandTHistory|  Brings up the Command-T history window. This works
                  exactly like the standard file window, except that it shows
                  the history of previously entered commands.

                                                *:CommandTLine*
|:CommandTLine|     Brings up the Command-T line search window. This works
                  exactly like the standard file window, except that it shows
                  the lines in the current buffer.

                                                *:CommandTMRU*
|:CommandTMRU|      Brings up the Command-T buffer window, except that matches
                  are shown in MRU (most recently used) order. If you prefer to
                  use this over the normal buffer finder, I suggest overwriting
                  the standard mapping with a command like:

                     :nnoremap <silent> <leader>b :CommandTMRU<CR>

                  Note that Command-T only starts recording most recently used
                  buffers when you first use a Command-T command or mapping;
                  this is an optimization to improve startup time, which you can
                  override by using either |:CommandTLoad| or |commandt#Load|.

                                                *:CommandTJumps*
|:CommandTJump|     Brings up the Command-T jumplist window.
                  This works exactly like the standard file window,
                  except that the selection is limited to files that
                  you already have in the jumplist. Note that jumps
                  can persist across Vim sessions (see Vim's |jumplist|
                  documentation for more info).

                                                *:CommandTSearch*
|:CommandTSearch|   Brings up the Command-T search window. This works
                  exactly like the standard file window, except that it shows
                  the history of previously used searches.

                                                *:CommandTTag*
|:CommandTTag|      Brings up the Command-T window tags window, which can
                  be used to select from the tags, if any, returned by
                  Vim's |taglist()| function. See Vim's |tag| documentation
                  for general info on tags.

                                                *:CommandTFlush*
|:CommandTFlush|    Instructs the plug-in to flush its path cache, causing
                  the directory to be rescanned for new or deleted paths
                  the next time the file window is shown (pressing <C-f> when
                  a match listing is visible flushes the cache immediately;
                  this mapping is configurable via the |g:CommandTRefreshMap|
                  setting). In addition, all configuration settings are
                  re-evaluated, causing any changes made to settings via the
                  |:let| command to be picked up.

                                                *:CommandTLoad*
|:CommandTLoad|     Immediately loads the plug-in files, if they haven't been
                  loaded already (normally, the files are loaded lazily the
                  first time you run a Command-T command or use a Command-T
                  mapping). This command may be useful for people wishing to
                  extend Command-T by "monkey patching" its functionality.

                                                *:CommandTOpen*
|:CommandTOpen|     The default command used by the various "AcceptSelection"
                  settings (|g:CommandTAcceptSelectionCommand|,
                  |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionTabCommand|,
                  |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionSplitCommand|, and
                  |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionVSplitCommand|) to open the
                  selected item. Implements smart "goto or open" logic that
                  will try to focus an existing, previously opened instance of
                  the selected item if possible, and only open a new tab or
                  split as a last resort. To work most usefully, should be
                  used with Vim's |'switchbuf'| setting set to "usetab".



MAPPINGS                                        *command-t-mappings*

By default Command-T comes with only three mappings:

                                                *<Plug>(CommandT)*

<Leader>t       bring up the Command-T file window

                                                *<Plug>(CommandTBuffer)*

<Leader>b       bring up the Command-T buffer window

                                                *<Plug>(CommandTJump)*

<Leader>j       bring up the Command-T jumplist window

Note that Command-T won't overwrite a pre-existing mapping so if you prefer
to define different mappings use lines like these in your |.vimrc|:

  nmap <silent> <Leader>t <Plug>(CommandT)
  nmap <silent> <Leader>b <Plug>(CommandTBuffer)
  nmap <silent> <Leader>j <Plug>(CommandTJump)

Replacing "<Leader>t", "<Leader>b" or "<Leader>j" with your mapping of choice.

Note that in the case of MacVim you actually can map to Command-T (written
as <D-t> in Vim) in your |.gvimrc| file if you first unmap the existing menu
binding of Command-T to "New Tab":

  if has("gui_macvim")
    macmenu &File.New\ Tab key=<nop>
    map <D-t> <Plug>(CommandT)
  endif

Additional mappings are available to target, but are not set up by default:

    *<Plug>(CommandTCommand)*

      Brings up the Command-T command window.

    *<Plug>(CommandTHelp)*

      Brings up the Command-T help search window.

    *<Plug>(CommandTHistory)*

      Brings up the Command-T command history search window.

    *<Plug>(CommandTLine)*

      Brings up the Command-T line-finder window.

    *<Plug>(CommandTMRU)*

      Brings up the Command-T most-recently-used buffer window.

    *<Plug>(CommandTSearch)*

      Brings up the Command-T search history window.

    *<Plug>(CommandTTag)*

      Brings up the Command-T tag search window.

Set up a mapping for any of these like so:

  nmap <silent> <Leader>h <Plug>(CommandTHelp)

When the Command-T window is active a number of other additional mappings
become available for doing things like moving between and selecting matches.
These are fully described above in the USAGE section, and settings for
overriding the mappings are listed below under OPTIONS.


OPTIONS                                         *command-t-options*

A number of options may be set in your |.vimrc| to influence the behaviour of
the plug-in. To set an option, you include a line like this in your |.vimrc|:

    let g:CommandTMaxFiles=20000

To have Command-T pick up new settings immediately (that is, without having
to restart Vim) you can issue the |:CommandTFlush| command after making
changes via |:let|.

Following is a list of all available options:

                                            *g:CommandTMaxFiles*
  |g:CommandTMaxFiles|                        number (default 100000)

      The maximum number of files that will be considered when scanning the
      current directory. Upon reaching this number scanning stops. This
      limit applies only to file listings and is ignored for buffer
      listings.

                                            *g:CommandTSuppressMaxFilesWarning*
  |g:CommandTSuppressMaxFilesWarning|         boolean (default 0)

      Suppress the warning that Command-T shows when hitting the
      |g:CommandTMaxFiles| limit during a scan.

                                            *g:CommandTMaxDepth*
  |g:CommandTMaxDepth|                        number (default 15)

      The maximum depth (levels of recursion) to be explored when scanning the
      current directory. Any directories at levels beyond this depth will be
      skipped.

                                            *g:CommandTMaxCachedDirectories*
  |g:CommandTMaxCachedDirectories|            number (default 1)

      The maximum number of directories whose contents should be cached when
      recursively scanning. With the default value of 1, each time you change
      directories the cache will be emptied and Command-T will have to
      rescan. Higher values will make Command-T hold more directories in the
      cache, bringing performance at the cost of memory usage. If set to 0,
      there is no limit on the number of cached directories.

                                            *g:CommandTMaxHeight*
  |g:CommandTMaxHeight|                       number (default: 15)

      The maximum height in lines the match window is allowed to expand to.
      If set to 0, the window will occupy as much of the available space as
      needed to show matching entries.

                                            *g:CommandTInputDebounce*
  |g:CommandTInputDebounce|                   number (default: 0)

      The number of milliseconds to wait before updating the match listing
      following a key-press. This can be used to avoid wasteful recomputation
      when making a rapid series of key-presses in a directory with many tens
      (or hundreds) of thousands of files.

                                            *g:CommandTFileScanner*
  |g:CommandTFileScanner|                     string (default: 'ruby')

      The underlying scanner implementation that should be used to explore the
      filesystem. Possible values are:

      - "ruby": uses built-in Ruby and should work everywhere, albeit slowly
        on large (many tens of thousands of files) hierarchies.

      - "find": uses the command-line tool of the same name, which can be much
        faster on large projects because it is written in pure C, but may not
        work on systems without the tool or with an incompatible version of
        the tool.

      - "git": uses `git ls-files` to quickly produce a list of files; when
        Git isn't available or the path being searched is not inside a Git
        repository falls back to "find".

      - "watchman": uses Watchman (https://github.com/facebook/watchman) if
        available; otherwise falls back to "find". Note that this scanner is
        intended for use with very large hierarchies (hundreds of thousands of
        files) and so the task of deciding which files should be included is
        entirely delegated to Watchman; this means that settings which
        Command-T would usually consult, such as
        |g:CommandTScanDotDirectories| are ignored.

                                            *g:CommandTTraverseSCM*
  |g:CommandTTraverseSCM|                     string (default: 'file')

      Instructs Command-T how to choose a root path when opening a file finder
      without an explicit path argument. Possible values are:

      - "file": starting from the file currently being edited, traverse
        upwards through the filesystem hierarchy until you find an SCM root
        (as indicated by the presence of a ".git", ".hg" or similar directory)
        and use that as the base path. If no such root is found, fall back to
        using Vim's present working directory as a root. The list of SCM
        directories that Command-T uses to detect an SCM root can be
        customized with the |g:CommandTSCMDirectories| option.

      - "dir": traverse upwards looking for an SCM root just like the "file"
        setting (above), but instead of starting from the file currently being
        edited, start from Vim's present working directory instead.

      - "pwd": use Vim's present working directory as a root (ie. attempt no
        traversal).

                                            *g:CommandTGitScanSubmodules*
  |g:CommandTGitScanSubmodules|               boolean (default: 0)

      If set to 1, Command-T will scan submodules (recursively) when using the
      "git" file scanner (see |g:CommandTFileScanner|).

                                            *g:CommandTGitIncludeUntracked*
  |g:CommandTGitIncludeUntracked|             boolean (default: 0)

      If set to 1, Command-T will include untracked files when using the "git"
      file scanner (see: |g:CommandTFileScanner|).

                                            *g:CommandTSCMDirectories*
  |g:CommandTSCMDirectories|    string (default: '.git,.hg,.svn,.bzr,_darcs')

      The marker directories that Command-T will use to identify SCM roots
      during traversal (see |g:CommandTTraverseSCM| above).


                                            *g:CommandTMinHeight*
  |g:CommandTMinHeight|                       number (default: 0)

      The minimum height in lines the match window is allowed to shrink to.
      If set to 0, will default to a single line. If set above the max height,
      will default to |g:CommandTMaxHeight|.

                                            *g:CommandTAlwaysShowDotFiles*
  |g:CommandTAlwaysShowDotFiles|              boolean (default: 0)

      When showing the file listing Command-T will by default show dot-files
      only if the entered search string contains a dot that could cause a
      dot-file to match. When set to a non-zero value, this setting instructs
      Command-T to always include matching dot-files in the match list
      regardless of whether the search string contains a dot. See also
      |g:CommandTNeverShowDotFiles|. Note that this setting only influences
      the file listing; the buffer listing treats dot-files like any other
      file.

                                            *g:CommandTNeverShowDotFiles*
  |g:CommandTNeverShowDotFiles|               boolean (default: 0)

      In the file listing, Command-T will by default show dot-files if the
      entered search string contains a dot that could cause a dot-file to
      match. When set to a non-zero value, this setting instructs Command-T to
      never show dot-files under any circumstances. Note that it is
      contradictory to set both this setting and
      |g:CommandTAlwaysShowDotFiles| to true, and if you do so Vim will suffer
      from headaches, nervous twitches, and sudden mood swings. This setting
      has no effect in buffer listings, where dot files are treated like any
      other file.

                                            *g:CommandTScanDotDirectories*
  |g:CommandTScanDotDirectories|              boolean (default: 0)

      Normally Command-T will not recurse into "dot-directories" (directories
      whose names begin with a dot) while performing its initial scan. Set
      this setting to a non-zero value to override this behavior and recurse.
      Note that this setting is completely independent of the
      |g:CommandTAlwaysShowDotFiles| and |g:CommandTNeverShowDotFiles|
      settings; those apply only to the selection and display of matches
      (after scanning has been performed), whereas
      |g:CommandTScanDotDirectories| affects the behaviour at scan-time.

      Note also that even with this setting off you can still use Command-T to
      open files inside a "dot-directory" such as `~/.vim`, but you have to use
      the |:cd| command to change into that directory first. For example:

        :cd ~/.vim
        :CommandT

                                            *g:CommandTMatchWindowAtTop*
  |g:CommandTMatchWindowAtTop|                boolean (default: 0)

      When this setting is off (the default) the match window will appear at
      the bottom so as to keep it near to the prompt. Turning it on causes the
      match window to appear at the top instead. This may be preferable if you
      if you have |g:CommandTMatchWindowReverse| set to 0 and want the best
      match (usually the first one) to appear in a fixed location on the
      screen rather than moving as the number of matches changes during
      typing.

                                            *g:CommandTMatchWindowReverse*
  |g:CommandTMatchWindowReverse|              boolean (default: 1)

      When this setting is on (the default), matches will be shown in reverse
      order, with the best match at the bottom (ie. closest to the prompt).
      The initially selected match will be the bottom-most, which is
      preferable if you want the best match to appear in a fixed location on
      the screen (independently of the number of results). When set to 0,
      matches will appear from top to bottom with the topmost being selected.

                                             *g:CommandTTagIncludeFilenames*
  |g:CommandTTagIncludeFilenames|              boolean (default: 0)

      When this setting is off (the default) the matches in the |:CommandTTag|
      listing do not include filenames.

                                             *g:CommandTCursorColor*
                                             string (default: 'Underlined')
  |g:CommandTCursorColor|

      Specifies the |:highlight| color that will be applied to the cursor in
      the Command-T prompt.

                                             *g:CommandTHighlightColor*
  |g:CommandTHighlightColor|                   string (default: 'PmenuSel')

      Specifies the |:highlight| color that will be used to show the currently
      selected item in the match listing window.

                                             *g:CommandTWildIgnore*
  |g:CommandTWildIgnore|                       string (default: none)

      Optionally override Vim's global |'wildignore'| setting during Command-T
      searches. If you wish to supplement rather than replace the global
      setting, you can use a syntax like:

        let g:CommandTWildIgnore=&wildignore . ",*/bower_components"

      To disable all |'wildignore'|-based filtering, set to an empty string:

        let g:CommandTWildIgnore=''

      See also |command-t-wildignore|.

                                             *g:CommandTIgnoreCase*
  |g:CommandTIgnoreCase|                       boolean (default: 1)

      Ignore case when searching. Defaults to on, which means that searching
      is case-insensitive by default. See also |g:CommandTSmartCase|.

                                             *g:CommandTRecursiveMatch*
  |g:CommandTRecursiveMatch|                   boolean (default: 1)

      Use this to downgrade Command-T's match-scoring algorithm to its older,
      cruder, less expensive form. Doing so may improve the responsiveness of
      the match listing, but at the cost of slightly less precision in the
      ranking of results.

                                             *g:CommandTSmartCase*
  |g:CommandTSmartCase|                        boolean (default: none)

      Override the |g:CommandTIgnoreCase| setting if the search pattern
      contains uppercase characters, forcing the match to be case-sensitive.
      If unset (which is the default), the value of the Vim |'smartcase'|
      setting will be used instead.

                                           *g:CommandTAcceptSelectionCommand*
  |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionCommand|         string (default: 'CommandTOpen e')

      The Vim command that will be used to open a selection from the match
      listing (via |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionMap|).

      See also, |:CommandTOpen|.

                                        *g:CommandTAcceptSelectionTabCommand*
  |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionTabCommand|   string (default: 'CommandTOpen tabe')

      The Vim command that will be used to open a selection from the match
      listing in a new tab (via |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionTabMap|).

      See also, |:CommandTOpen|.

                                        *g:CommandTAcceptSelectionSplitCommand*
  |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionSplitCommand| string (default: 'CommandTOpen sp')

      The Vim command that will be used to open a selection from the match
      listing in a split (via |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionSplitMap|).

      See also, |:CommandTOpen|.

                                    *g:CommandTAcceptSelectionVsplitCommand*
                                    string (default: 'CommandTOpen vs')
  |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionVSplitCommand|

      The Vim command that will be used to open a selection from the match
      listing in a vertical split (via |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionVSplitMap|).

      See also, |:CommandTOpen|.

                        *g:CommandTWindowFilter*
                        string (default: '!&buflisted && &buftype == "nofile"')
  |g:CommandTWindowFilter|

      An expression that will be used to filter out windows that Command-T
      should avoid using to open the selected file. The expression should
      evaluate to a boolean (0 or 1).

      The default expression skips windows containing unlisted buffers that are
      not backed by files (examples of such files include NERDTree windows). As
      an example of the kind of custom expression you may wish to supply, if
      you are using NERDTree to hijack |netrw| windows ('NERDTreeHijackNetrw')
      and you want to make sure that Command-T does not skip over those, you
      could use:
>
      let g:CommandTWindowFilter='!&buflisted && &buftype == "nofile" && !exists("w:netrw_liststyle")"
<
                                             *g:CommandTEncoding*
  |g:CommandTEncoding|                         string (default: none)

      In most environments Command-T will work just fine using the character
      encoding settings from your local environment. This setting can be used
      to force Command-T to use a specific encoding, such as "UTF-8", if your
      environment ends up defaulting to an undesired encoding, such as
      "ASCII-8BIT".

                                             *g:CommandTIgnoreSpaces*
  |g:CommandTIgnoreSpaces|                     boolean (default: 1)

      When typing a search term into Command-T, ignore spaces. When set to 0,
      Command-T will search for literal spaces inside file names.

As well as the basic options listed above, there are a number of settings that
can be used to override the default key mappings used by Command-T. For
example, to set <C-x> as the mapping for cancelling (dismissing) the Command-T
window, you would add the following to your |.vimrc|:

  let g:CommandTCancelMap='<C-x>'

Multiple, alternative mappings may be specified using list syntax:

  let g:CommandTCancelMap=['<C-x>', '<C-c>']

Following is a list of all map settings and their defaults:

In addition to the options provided by Command-T itself, some of Vim's own
settings can be used to control behavior:

                                               *command-t-wildignore*
  |'wildignore'|                                 string (default: '')

      Vim's |'wildignore'| setting is used to determine which files should be
      excluded from listings. This is a comma-separated list of glob patterns.
      It defaults to the empty string, but common settings include "*.o,*.obj"
      (to exclude object files) or "*/.git,*/.svn" (to exclude SCM
      metadata directories). For example:

        :set wildignore+=*.o,*.obj

      A pattern such as "*/vendor/rails" would exclude all files and
      subdirectories inside the "vendor/rails" directory.

      See the |'wildignore'| documentation for more information. Here is an
      overview of how different common patterns affect Vim and Command-T
      behavior:

      wildignore   File      File       Dir      Dir       Dir + File
      Pattern      "foo"     "a/foo"    "foo"    "a/foo"   "a/foo/b"
      ---------------------------------------------------------------
      `foo`          match     match      miss     miss      miss
      `foo/`         miss      miss       miss     miss      miss
      `foo/*`        miss      miss       miss     miss      miss
      `*/foo`        match     match      match    match     match
      `*/foo/`       miss      miss       match    miss      miss
      `*/foo/*`      miss      miss       match    match     match

      In short, in general you want to use patterns like:

      - `foo`: to match a file at any level.
      - `*.foo`: to match a file with an extension at any level.
      - `*/foo`: to match a file or directory at any level.
      - `*/foo/*`: to match a directory at any level.

      If you want to influence Command-T's file exclusion behavior without
      changing your global |'wildignore'| setting, you can use the
      |g:CommandTWildIgnore| setting to apply an override that takes effect
      only during Command-T searches.


INTEGRATION AND EXTENSIBILITY         *command-t-integration-and-extensibility*

For the purposes of integrating with other plug-ins, or otherwise extending
Command-T's functionality, a number of hooks and features are provided. Note
that making use of any of these extension points is considered to be advanced
configuration, and the more invasive the modifications, the greater the risk
that they will interact poorly with future versions of Command-T. Proceed with
caution.

                                                *command-t-filetype*
command-t filetype ~

Command-T displays its match listing using a special Vim buffer with a
filetype of  `command-t`. This can be used in |ftplugins| or elsewhere to set up
an |autocommand| or apply custom configuration.

For example of an |ftplugin| that sets a custom 'statusline' for the
Command-T match listing buffer, see: https://rfr.to/f

                                                *command-t-load*
                                                *commandt#Load*
Eager loading with commandt#CommandTLoad ~

In order to minimize Vim startup time, most of Command-T's functionality is
only loaded on first use, via Vim's |autoload| mechanism.

If you should wish to monkey patch some Command-T functionality, the
`commandt#Load()` function (also exposed via the |:CommandTLoad| command) is
provided as a means of eager-loading Command-T's code, so that you can go
ahead and patch it.

                                                *commandt#ActiveFinder*
                                                *commandt#CheckBuffer*
                                                *commandt#Path*
Statusline hooks ~

A number of methods are provided that may be useful for creating a
context-sensitive 'statusline'.

- `commandt#ActiveFinder()`: Returns the class name of the currently
  active finder.
- `commandt#Path()`: Returns the path that Command-T is currently
  searching.
- `commandt#CheckBuffer()`: Takes a buffer number and returns true if
  it is the Command-T match listing buffer.

                                                *command-t-custom-autocommands*
Custom autocommands ~

                                                *CommandTWillShowMatchListing*
                                                *CommandTDidHideMatchListing*

Command-T runs the following "User" autocommands just prior to showing the
match listing window and just after hiding it:

  - CommandTWillShowMatchListing
  - CommandTDidHideMatchListing

For example, to call a pair of custom functions in response to these events,
you might do: >

   autocmd! User CommandTWillShowMatchListing
   autocmd User CommandTWillShowMatchListing call CustomWillShow()
   autocmd! User CommandTDidHideMatchListing
   autocmd User CommandTDidHideMatchListing call CustomDidHide()
<

FAQ                                             *command-t-faq*

Why does my build fail with "unknown argument -multiply_definedsuppress"? ~

You may see this on OS X Mavericks when building with the Clang compiler
against the system Ruby. This is an unfortunate Apple bug that breaks
compilation of many Ruby gems with native extensions on Mavericks. It has been
worked around in the upstream Ruby version, but won't be fixed in OS X until
Apple updates their supplied version of Ruby (most likely this won't be until
the next major release):

  https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/9624

Workarounds include building your own Ruby (and then your own Vim and
Command-T), or more simply, building with the following `ARCHFLAGS` set:

  ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future ruby extconf.rb
  make

Why can't I open in a split with <C-CR> and <C-s> in the terminal? ~

It's likely that <C-CR> won't work in most terminals, because the keycode that
is sent to processes running inside them is identical to <CR>; when you type
<C-CR>, terminal Vim literally "sees" <CR>. Unfortunately, there is no
workaround for this.

If you find that <C-s> also doesn't work the most likely explanation is that
XON/XOFF flow control is enabled; this is the default in many environments.
This means that when you press <C-s> all input to the terminal is suspended
until you release it by hitting <C-q>. While input is suspended you may think
your terminal has frozen, but it hasn't.

To disable flow control, add the following to your `.zshrc` or
`.bash_profile`:

  stty -ixon -ixoff

See the `stty` man page for more details.

Why doesn't the Escape key close the match listing in terminal Vim? ~

In some terminals such as xterm the Escape key misbehaves, so Command-T
doesn't set up a mapping for it. If you want to try using the escape key
anyway, you can add something like the following to your |.vimrc| file:

  if &term =~ "xterm" || &term =~ "screen"
    let g:CommandTCancelMap = ['<ESC>', '<C-c>']
  endif

This configuration has worked for me with recent versions of Vim on multiple
platforms (OS X, CentOS etc).


TIPS                                            *command-t-tips*

Working with very large repositories ~

One of the primary motivations for writing Command-T was to get fast, robust
high-quality matches even on large hierarchies. The larger the hierarchy, the
more important having good file navigation becomes. This is why Command-T's
performance-critical sections are written in C. This requires a compilation
step and makes Command-T harder to install than similar plug-ins which are
written in pure Vimscript, and can be a disincentive against use. This is a
conscious trade-off; the goal isn't to have as many users as possible, but
rather to provide the best performance at the highest quality.

The speed of the core is high enough that Command-T can afford to burn a bunch
of extra cycles -- using its recursive matching algorithm -- looking for a
higher-quality, more intuitive ranking of search results. Again, the larger
the hierarchy, the more important the quality of result ranking becomes.

Nevertheless, for extremely large hierarchies (of the order of 500,000 files)
some tuning is required in order to get useful and usable performance levels.
Here are some useful example settings:

    let g:CommandTMaxHeight = 30

You want the match listing window to be large enough that you can get useful
feedback about how your search query is going; in large hierarchies there may
be many, many matches for a given query. At the same time, you don't want Vim
wasting valuable cycles repainting a large portion of the screen area,
especially on a large display. Setting the limit to 30 or similar is a
reasonable compromise.

    let g:CommandTMaxFiles = 500000

The default limit of 30,000 files prevents Command-T from "seeing" many of the
files in a large directory hierarchy so you need to increase this limit.

    let g:CommandTInputDebounce = 50

Wait for 50ms of keyboard inactivity before computing search results. For
example, if you are enter "foobar" quickly (ie. within 1 second), there is
little sense in fetching the results for "f", "fo", "foo", "foob", "fooba" and
finally "foobar". Instead, we can just fetch the results for "foobar". This
setting trades off some immediate responsiveness at the micro level for
better performance (real and perceived) and a better search experience
overall.

    let g:CommandTFileScanner = 'watchman'

On a large hierarchy with of the order of 500,000 files, scanning a directory
tree with a tool like the `find` executable may take literally minutes with a
cold cache. Once the cache is warm, the same `find` run may take only a second
or two. Command-T provides a "find" scanner to leverage this performance, but
for truly immense repos the "watchman" scanner is the tool of choice.

This scanner delegates the task of finding files to Facebook's `watchman` tool
(https://github.com/facebook/watchman), which can return results for a 500,000
file hierarchy within about a second.

Note that Watchman has a range of configuration options that can be applied by
files such as `/etc/watchman.json` or per-direcory `.watchmanconfig` files and
which may affect how Command-T works. For example, if your configuration has a
`root_restrict_files` setting that makes Watchman only work with roots that
look like Git or Mercurial repos, then Command-T will fall back to using the
"find" scanner any time you invoke it on a non-repo directory. For
simplicity's sake, it is probably a good idea to use Vim and Command-T
anchored at the root level of your repository in any case.

    let g:CommandTMaxCachedDirectories = 10

Command-T will internally cache up to 10 different directories, so even if you
|cd| repeatedly, it should only need to scan each directory once.

It's advisable to keep a long-running Vim instance in place and let it cache
the directory listings rather than repeatedly closing and re-opening Vim in
order to edit every file. On those occasions when you do need to flush the
cache (ie. with |CommandTFlush| or <C-f> in the match listing window), use of
the Watchman scanner should make the delay barely noticeable.

    let g:CommandTSmartCase = 1

Makes Command-T perform case-sensitive matching whenever the search pattern
includes an uppercase letter. This allows you to narrow the search results
listing with fewer keystrokes. See also |g:CommandTIgnoreCase|.

    let g:CommandTRecursiveMatch = 0

This one is a little more subjective. You may want to downgrade Command-T's
match-scoring algorithm to a cheaper but less precise method to save some
cycles. This finds matches more quickly at the possible cost of ranking them
slightly less precisely. Whether applying this setting helps or hurts you in a
very large repo is probably repo-dependent. For reference, I do not use this
setting, even in repos of over 500,000 files.

As noted in the introduction, Command-T works best when you adopt a
"path-centric" mentality. This is especially true on very large hierarchies.
For example, if you're looking for a file at:

  lib/third-party/adapters/restful-services/foobar/foobar-manager.js

you'll be able to narrow your search results down more narrowly if you search
with a query like "librestfoofooman" than "foobar-manager.js". This evidently
requires that you know where the file you're wanting to open exists, but
again, this is a concious design decision: Command-T is made to enable people
who know what they want to open and where it is to open it as quickly as
possible; other tools such as NERDTree exist for visually exploring an unknown
hierarchy.

Over time, you will get a feel for how economical you can afford to be with
your search queries in a given repo. In the example above, if "foo" is not a
very common pattern in your hierarchy, then you may find that you can find
what you need with a very concise query such as "foomanjs". With time, this
kind of ongoing calibration will come quite naturally.

Finally, it is important to be on a relatively recent version of Command-T to
fully benefit from the available performance enhancements:

- Version 3.1 (March 2016) sped up the matching algorithm by 17x.
- Version 2.0 (December 2015) added the |g:CommandTRecursiveMatch| option.
- Version 1.10 (July 2014) added the |g:CommandTIgnoreCase| and
  |g:CommandTSmartCase| options.
- Version 1.9 (May 2014) tweaked memoization algorithm for a 10% speed boost.
- Version 1.8 (March 2014) sped up the Watchman file scanner by switching its
  communication from the JSON to the binary Watchman protocol.
- Version 1.7 (February 2014) added the |g:CommandTInputDebounce| and
  |g:CommandTFileScanner| settings, along with support for the Watchman file
  scanner.
- Version 1.6 (December 2013) added parallelized search.
- Version 1.5 (September 2013) added memoization to the matching algorithm,
  improving general performance on large hierarchies, but delivering
  spectacular gains on hierarchies with "pathological" characteristics that
  lead the algorithm to exhibit degenerate behavior.

Additionally, Hanson Wang, Jacek Wysocki and Yiding Jia wrote patches which
were not directly included but which served as a model for changes that did
end up making it in.

As this was the first Vim plug-in I had ever written I was heavily influenced
by the design of the LustyExplorer plug-in by Stephen Bach, which I understand
was one of the largest Ruby-based Vim plug-ins at the time.

While the Command-T codebase doesn't contain any code directly copied from
LustyExplorer, I did use it as a reference for answers to basic questions (like
"How do you do 'X' in a Ruby-based Vim plug-in?"), and also copied some basic
architectural decisions (like the division of the code into Prompt, Settings
and MatchWindow classes).

LustyExplorer is available from:

DEVELOPMENT                                     *command-t-development*

Development in progress can be inspected at:

  https://github.com/wincent/command-t

the clone URL for which is:

  https://github.com/wincent/command-t.git

Mirrors exist on GitLab and BitBucket, and are automatically updated once per
hour:

  https://gitlab.com/wincent/command-t
  https://bitbucket.org/ghurrell/command-t

Patches are welcome via the usual mechanisms (pull requests, email, posting to
the project issue tracker etc).

As many users choose to track Command-T using Pathogen or similar, which often
means running a version later than the last official release, the intention is
that the "master" branch should be kept in a stable and reliable state as much
as possible.

Riskier changes are first cooked on the "next" branch for a period before
being merged into master. You can track this branch if you're feeling wild and
experimental, but note that the "next" branch may periodically be rewound
(force-updated) to keep it in sync with the "master" branch after each

HISTORY                                         *command-t-history*

master (not yet released) ~

- Fix unlisted buffers showing up in |:CommandTBuffer| listing on Neovim.
- Fix edge cases with opening selections in tabs (#315).

5.0.2 (7 September 2017) ~

- Fix a RangeError on 64-bit Windows (#304, patch from Adrian Keet).
- Fix issue switching back to previously opened file in another tab (#306).
- Fix inability to open some help targets with |:CommandTHelp| (#307).
- Similar to #307, make |:CommandTCommand| work with commands containing
  special characters.
- Again similar to #307, prevent special characters in tags from being escaped
  when using |:CommandTTag|.

5.0.1 (18 August 2017) ~

- Fixed inability to open a top-level file with a name matching a previously
  opened file (#295).
- Fixed a related issue where previously opened file would cause a file to be
  opened directly rather than in the desired split/tab (#298).
- Tweaked <c-w> mapping behavior to better match what other readline-ish
  implementations do, especially with respect to moving past punctuation
  (#301).

5.0 (6 June 2017) ~

- Command-T now uses |:map-<nowait>|, when available, when setting up mappings.
- 'wildignore' filtering is now always performed by producing an equivalent
  regular expression and applying that; previously this only happened with
  the "watchman" file scanner (includes a bug fix from Henric Trotzig).
- Fixed mis-memoization of |:CommandTHelp| and |:CommandTJump| finders
  (whichever one you used first would be used for both).
- Added mapping (<C-d>) to delete a buffer from the buffer list (patch from
  Max Timkovich).
- Added |g:CommandTGitIncludeUntracked| option (patch from Steven Stallion).
- Added |:CommandTOpen|, which implements smart "goto or open" functionality,
  and adjust |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionCommand|,
  |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionTabCommand|,
  |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionSplitCommand|, and
  |g:CommandTAcceptSelectionVSplitCommand| to use it by default. Their default
  values have been changed from "e", "tabe", "sp" and "vs" to "CommandTOpen
  e", "CommandTOpen tabe", "CommandTOpen sp" and "CommandTOpen vs",
  respectively. Use with |'switchbuf'| set to "usetab" for maximum effect.
- Added |g:CommandTWindowFilter| for customizing the filtering expression that
  is used to determine which windows Command-T should not open selected
  files in.

4.0 (16 May 2016) ~

- A non-leading dot in the search query can now match against dot-files and
  "dot-directories" in non-leading path components.
- Matching algorithm sped up by about 17x (with help from Hanson Wang).
- |g:CommandTInputDebounce| now defaults to 0, as the recent optimizations
  make debouncing largely unnecessary.
- Added |:CommandTHelp| for jumping to locations in the help, and an
  accompanying mapping, |<Plug>(CommandTHelp)|.
- Added |:CommandTLine| for jumping to lines within the current buffer, and a
  corresponding mapping, |<Plug>(CommandTLine)|.
- Added |:CommandTHistory| for jumping to previously entered commands, and a
  corresponding mapping, |<Plug>(CommandTHistory)|.
- Added |:CommandTSearch| for jumping to previously entered searches, and a
  corresponding mapping, |<Plug>(CommandTSearch)|.
- Added |:CommandTCommand| for finding commands, and a corresponding mapping,
  |<Plug>(CommandTCommand)|.
- Added |<Plug>(CommandTMRU)| and |<Plug>(CommandTTag)| mappings.
- The "ruby" and "find" scanners now show numerical progress in the prompt
  area during their scans.
- Removed functionality that was previously deprecated in 2.0.
- Fix inability to type "^" and "|" at the prompt.
- Make it possible to completely disable |'wildignore'|-based filtering by
  setting |g:CommandTWildIgnore| to an empty string.
- The "watchman" file scanner now respects |'wildignore'| and
  |g:CommandTWildIgnore| by constructing an equivalent regular expression and
  using that for filtering.
- Show a warning when hitting |g:CommandTMaxFiles|, and add a corresponding
  |g:CommandTSuppressMaxFilesWarning| setting to suppress the warning.

3.0.2 (9 February 2016) ~

- Minimize flicker on opening and closing the match listing in MacVim.
- Add |CommandTWillShowMatchListing| and |CommandTDidHideMatchListing| "User"
  autocommands.

3.0.1 (25 January 2016) ~

- restore compatibility with Ruby 1.8.7.

3.0 (19 January 2016) ~

- change |g:CommandTIgnoreSpaces| default value to 1.
- change |g:CommandTMatchWindowReverse| default value to 1.
- change |g:CommandTMaxHeight| default value to 15.

- add |:CommandTIgnoreSpaces| option (patch from KJ Tsanaktsidis)
- make Command-T resilient to people deleting its hidden, unlisted buffer
- the match listing buffer now has filetype "command-t", which may be useful
  for detectability/extensibility
- Command-T now sets the name of the match listing buffer according to how it
  was invoked (ie. for the file finder, the name is "Command-T [Files]", for
  the buffer finder, the name is "Command-T [Buffers]", and so on);
  previously the name was a fixed as "GoToFile" regardless of the active
  finder type
- Many internal function names have changed, so if you or your plug-ins are

  to make it clear that they are intended only for internal use:
  - `CommandTAcceptSelection()` is now `commandt#private#AcceptSelection()`
  - `CommandTAcceptSelectionSplit()` is now `commandt#private#AcceptSelectionSplit()`
  - `CommandTAcceptSelectionTab()` is now `commandt#private#AcceptSelectionTab()`

  from Daniel Hahler)
- skip set-up of |<Esc>| key mapping on rxvt terminals (patch from Daniel
  Hahler)
- add |g:CommandTGitScanSubmodules| option, which can be used to recursively
  scan submodules when the "git" file scanner is used (patch from Ben Boeckel)
- fix for not falling back to "find"-based scanner when a Watchman-related
  error occurs

1.11.4 (4 November 2014) ~

- fix infinite loop on Windows when |g:CommandTTraverseSCM| is set to a value
  other than "pwd" (bug present since 1.11)
- handle unwanted split edgecase when |'hidden'| is set, the current buffer is

- fix a glitch in the release process; the plugin itself is unchanged since
  1.1b

1.1b (26 March 2011) ~

- add |:CommandTBuffer| command for quickly selecting among open buffers

1.0.1 (5 January 2011) ~

- work around bug when mapping |:CommandTFlush|, wherein the default mapping
  for |:CommandT| would not be set up
- clean up when leaving the Command-T buffer via unexpected means (such as
  with <C-W k> or similar)

1.0 (26 November 2010) ~

- make relative path simplification work on Windows

1.0b (5 November 2010) ~

- work around platform-specific Vim 7.3 bug seen by some users (wherein
  Vim always falsely reports to Ruby that the buffer numbers is 0)
- re-use the buffer that is used to show the match listing, rather than
  throwing it away and recreating it each time Command-T is shown; this
  stops the buffer numbers from creeping up needlessly

0.9 (8 October 2010) ~

- use relative paths when opening files inside the current working directory
  in order to keep buffer listings as brief as possible (patch from Matthew
  Todd)

0.8.1 (14 September 2010) ~

- fix mapping issues for users who have set |'notimeout'| (patch from Sung
  Pae)

0.8 (19 August 2010) ~

- overrides for the default mappings can now be lists of strings, allowing
  multiple mappings to be defined for any given action
- <Leader>t mapping only set up if no other map for |:CommandT| exists
  (patch from Scott Bronson)
- prevent folds from appearing in the match listing
- tweaks to avoid the likelihood of "Not enough room" errors when trying to
  open files
- watch out for "nil" windows when restoring window dimensions
- optimizations (avoid some repeated downcasing)
- move all Ruby files under the "command-t" subdirectory and avoid polluting
  the "Vim" module namespace

0.8b (11 July 2010) ~

- large overhaul of the scoring algorithm to make the ordering of returned
  results more intuitive; given the scope of the changes and room for
  optimization of the new algorithm, this release is labelled as "beta"

0.7 (10 June 2010) ~

- handle more |'wildignore'| patterns by delegating to Vim's own |expand()|
  function; with this change it is now viable to exclude patterns such as
  'vendor/rails/**' in addition to filename-only patterns like '*.o' and
  '.git' (patch from Mike Lundy)
- always sort results alphabetically for empty search strings; this eliminates
  filesystem-specific variations (patch from Mike Lundy)

0.6 (28 April 2010) ~

- |:CommandT| now accepts an optional parameter to specify the starting
  directory, temporarily overriding the usual default of Vim's |:pwd|
- fix truncated paths when operating from root directory

0.5.1 (11 April 2010) ~

- fix for Ruby 1.9 compatibility regression introduced in 0.5
- documentation enhancements, specifically targetted at Windows users

0.5 (3 April 2010) ~

- remove broken |<Esc>| key mapping on vt100 and xterm terminals
- provide settings for overriding default mappings
- minor performance optimization

- documentation fixes and enhancements
- internal refactoring and simplification

0.3 (24 March 2010) ~

- add |g:CommandTMaxHeight| setting for controlling the maximum height of the
  match window (patch from Lucas de Vries)
- fix bug where |'list'| setting might be inappropriately set after dismissing
  Command-T
- compatibility fix for different behaviour of "autoload" under Ruby 1.9.1
- avoid "highlight group not found" warning when run under a version of Vim
  that does not have syntax highlighting support
- open in split when opening normally would fail due to |'hidden'| and
  |'modified'| values

0.2 (23 March 2010) ~

- compatibility fixes for compilation under Ruby 1.9 series
- compatibility fixes for compilation under Ruby 1.8.5
- compatibility fixes for Windows and other non-UNIX platforms
- suppress "mapping already exists" message if <Leader>t mapping is already
  defined when plug-in is loaded
- exclude paths based on |'wildignore'| setting rather than a hardcoded
  regular expression

0.1 (22 March 2010) ~
